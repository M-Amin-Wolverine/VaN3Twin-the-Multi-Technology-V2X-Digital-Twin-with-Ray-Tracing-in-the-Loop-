# VaN3Twin: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Network Simulator

![VaN3Twin Simulation Example](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=VaN3Twin+Simulation+Diagram)

## Overview
**VaN3Twin** is a comprehensive simulator for **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)** and **Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)** communications, enabling full **V2X network analysis**. It models both **Line-of-Sight (LoS)** and **Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS)** conditions, as well as multipath effects in complex urban environments.

---

## Features
- Supports various **V2X scenarios** and protocols such as **IEEE 802.11p** and **NR-V2X**.  
- Includes a **Ray Tracer** for accurate channel and signal propagation modeling.  
- Evaluates performance metrics including **RSSI**, **SINR**, **PRR**, and **Data Rate (DR)**.  
- Integrates with **OpenStreetMap** for realistic maps and **SUMO** for traffic simulation.  
- Designed to simulate NLoS conditions and multipath channel effects in urban environments.  

---

## Tools & Platforms Used
- **Google Colab** for simulation execution.  
- **Google Drive** for storing and sharing datasets.  
- Open-source programming tools for V2X modeling and analysis.  
- Supports scenario analysis for autonomous vehicles and communication protocols.  

---

## Applications
- Scientific research in V2X communications.  
- Design and analysis of vehicular communication protocols and algorithms.  
- Simulation of complex urban scenarios for autonomous driving.
